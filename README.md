# Skripts
This repository contains all of my public skripts, while I plan to maintiane them as long as possible I want
everyone to feel free and help with wether it's a simple bug fix or even a complete recode of a section.

## How branches will work
Due to the fact skript's major updates tend to lead to broken skripts nearly every update
I've decided that after every major update I'll create a new branch labled something like `2.6` using the last major update
this is so seperate them into their own sections to allow people to go back and view them prior to latest changes

## How to contact me
If you ever need to contact me feel to via discord at `Fusezion#3045`.
Although I'd prefer you to create an issue prior to contacting me on discord.
However if you believe it's an urgant issue then feel free to DM me.
